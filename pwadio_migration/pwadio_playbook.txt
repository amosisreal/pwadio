Migrating from php pwadio to python pwadio.

1) get django working at site5 dammit.
2) use current pwadio sqlite3 db at site5 - it is still current.
3) write converters from sqlite3 to django models
	itunes table
	processing time table
	running playlist
		- create artists / tracks on the fly
4) write parser that will traverse running playlist, then build music service lookups on the fly.

ID and cleanup unused files / data cause this is getting messy.
